    <h2>What is Civic Tech?</h2>
    <p><strong>TL;DR: The intersection of technology and public life.</strong></p>
    <p>A civic philosophy and a community using technology to improve public, government, and civic process and services, or to address issues of shared public concern using methods of development that are user-centred, iterative, data-driven, open sourced, and collaborative.</p>
    <p>See our <a href="/projects/">Toronto projects list</a> and <a href="/resources/">resources page</a> for reference and more information.</p>
